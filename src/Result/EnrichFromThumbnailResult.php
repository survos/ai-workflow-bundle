/**
 * Result of a single-pass thumbnail enrichment call.
 *
 * Confidence levels are explicit and per-field — the AI is encouraged to
 * guess intelligently as long as it labels its guesses.
 *
 * Confidence scale:
 *   high   — clearly visible or certain from context
 *   medium — strongly suggested by visual evidence
 *   low    — plausible inference, not directly visible
 *
 * Speculative observations are kept separate from factual tags so they
 * can be displayed/indexed differently. A cataloguer can promote or reject them.
 *
 * Example speculative observation:
 *   "Highly likely part of an SS Allgemeine uniform, late WWII period —
 *    collar insignia and cut match 1944-45 pattern."
 *
 * dense_summary ≤350 chars: combines image + known metadata for chatbot/meili.
